## Motivation
Now Hosted: Click [SlapFace](https://slapeface.netlify.app) to visit the website.

<p>
Problem:
Lack of a dedicated platform to archive and verify prophecies, which often get lost on various social media channels. This makes it difficult to track and verify the accuracy of prophecies over time.
</P> 
<p>
Provide a platform for people to share and verify prophecies. The motivation behind this idea is to have a long-term, low-maintenance website where interesting conclusions can be posted and verified later, without the fear of the post getting lost in various social media channels. The website can be used by anyone who wants to share their opinions and prophecies.
</p>

## What does the Application do

- Every user allow to comment on others posts
### User Login System:
- Users have different account to store what they have posted or voted

### Prophecy category:
- Technology, political, sport, entertainment, etc..
- User can choose what category to follow 
### From the Future/Get Slapped 
- This is a section for the highest points user and the lowest points user
- From the future shows the best 5 and the Get Slapped in the Face will show the worst 5.
### User reward points system
- Users who vote will consume 10 points from the account
- Users who voted the correct answer will earn points
